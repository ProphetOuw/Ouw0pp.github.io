# Context

## Payments
!!!note "Payment availability"
    Payments are available in robux, but not always in USD. If you prefer USD, you should ask if the option is available.
### Front-end payment
Front end developers will get paid 250K per skill. If you are working with someone, this can be split in whatever manner you prefer
!!!warning "advice against half assing"
    If some directions are ignored you won't be paid the full amount, instead some deductions will be taken. This will only happen if we warn you countless times and the changes aren't made.
### Skill-implementation payment
If you are also a front end developer, these payments will be given ontop of the payment stated in the previous block.

The difficulty in which a skill is assumed may change before or after the implementation is done, And it may change depending on the amount of work you'd have to do. If you are provided with resources, this may change the assumed difficulty.

#### My task as a front end developer
You shall follow the front end framework
#### My task as a skill implementing backend developer
The more you do it, the easier it gets. Your job is to reskin or create skills using the work of a front end developer.
#### Advantages of a backend skill implementer/a front end who also implements skills
Your chances of getting rehired/retain a permenant position on the team will sky rocket
!!!question "'Why bother with implementing skills to the framework when i already made 250K robux per skill xD'"
    In order to make that 250K robux you would of had made somewhat of a backend for the skill, why not just use a specific framework and make some extra money? And it takes Ouw 30mins to 1 hour to implement a skill, imagine making up to 550 dollars for 30 minutes worth of work.
